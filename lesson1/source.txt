Once upon a NOUN, in a NOUN far away, there was a little ADJ NOUN, the prettiest who was ever seen. Her NOUN was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother VERBed on her ADV. This ADJ NOUN had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited her so ADV and ADV that everybody called her ADJ ADJ Riding Hood. One day her mother, having made ADJ cakes, said to her, 'VERB, my dear, and VERB how your grandmother is VERBing, for I VERB she has been ADV ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.'
