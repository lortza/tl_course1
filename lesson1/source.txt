Once upon a NOUN there lived in a certain NOUN a little ADJECTIVE girl, the prettiest NOUN who was ever seen. Her NOUN was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother VERBed on her ADVERB. This ADJECTIVE NOUN had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so ADVERB ADVERB that everybody called her ADJECTIVE ADJECTIVE Riding Hood.
One day her mother, having made ADJECTIVE cakes, said to her, "VERB, my dear, and VERB how your grandmother is VERBing, for I VERB she has been ADVERB ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."

Moral: Children, especially attractive, well bred young ladies, should never talk to strangers, for if they should do so, they may well provide dinner for a wolf. I say "wolf," but there are various kinds of wolves. There are also those who are charming, quiet, polite, unassuming, complacent, and sweet, who pursue young women at home and in the streets. And unfortunately, it is these gentle wolves who are the most dangerous ones of all.
